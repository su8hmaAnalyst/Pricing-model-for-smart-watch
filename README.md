# Pricing-model-for-smart-watch
Created a pricing model for new smart watch launched by NuWave electronics company(Dummy Company).

# Situation:
NuWave wants to launch a new smartwatch, which will be one of their flagship products. They plan to launch the watch with an OLED display.
They intend to first enter the market and gain at least 5% of the market share.
As a new player in the smartwatch market, they want to price the watch lower than their competition (selling at ₹ 7,799).
The demand in such a market is elastic, meaning a small price change can cause a significant change in demand.
To achieve 5% of the market share, NuWave needs to sell at least 1,800 units per day. Assume NuWave can completely fulfil the demand for the day.

# Complication:
For NuWave to sell 1,800 smartwatches a day, they need to have a certain level of inventory.
Each smartwatch requires one OLED panel. For smooth production, they need to have its stock as well.
NuWave approached Samsung for acquiring the panels. Samsung quoted the price at ₹ 1,475 for one unit. The price will decrease as the order quantity increases.
NuWave can store only 2000 OLED panels in their own facility. To store more, they need a warehouse, which will cost them ₹ 12,000/day. They can store 10,000 OLED panel units in one warehouse.
The warehouse should not be underutilized.
Now, as a business analyst at NuWave, your job is to find out:
1.	At what price should they sell one unit, to gain a 5% market share and earn at least a 2% profit margin?
2.	Minimum order quantity of panels at that price point so NuWave doesn't make a loss.

# Key Expectations from Analysis:
Build a spreadsheet model to find out the selling price of one smartwatch so that:
1.	NuWave can gain a 5% market share.
    -	(company_sales/industry_sales)over a period of time.
2.	Earn at least a 2% profit margin.
  -	(Revenue-cost)/Revenue
